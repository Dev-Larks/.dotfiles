dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    sudo make clean install


Running dwm
-----------

Add the below lines to ~/.profile

    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME:$HOME/bin:$HOME/dwmscripts:/usr/local/bin:$HOME/.local/share/dwm

Add the below line to ~/.bash_profile

    [[ -f ~/.profile ]] && . ~/.profile

Place dwm bar script in the below directory

    ~/.local/share/dwm/autostart

Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    # launch dwm bar
    autostart.sh

    # set wallpaper
    ~/.fehbg &

    # launch dwm
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.def.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
